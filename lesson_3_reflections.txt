When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to share.	

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	When things happen automatically, it can confuse you that your state is constantly changing.  What if a collaborator introduces a bug?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks only happen on github.
	clones copy a repository.
	branches make a series of changes without altering the state of the starting point.
